# MSc-Computer-Science-Coursework
This folder contains the Java coursework that was submitted and marked during my MSc Computer Science conversion course, in order of submission. The work is largely quite simplistic, as it was designed to help teach the language and programming concepts. 

Concepts covered include object oriented structure, user input, creating algorithms from loops, collections etc., inheritance (interfaces and abstract classes), polymorphism, generics, defensive programming, immutability, overiding Object class methods (toString, equals, hashcode), object factories, multithreading and race conditions
